#' United States county and state level data from the New York Times
#'
#' Each row of data reports cumulative counts based on best reporting
#' up to the moment published. The NYT states that it may revise
#' earlier entries in the data when they receive new information.
#'
#' @details
#'
#' From the NYTimes github README:
#'
#' The New York Times is releasing a series of data files with
#' cumulative counts of coronavirus cases in the United States, at the
#' state and county level, over time. We are compiling this time
#' series data from state and local governments and health departments
#' in an attempt to provide a complete record of the ongoing outbreak.
#' 
#' Since late January, The Times has tracked cases of coronavirus in
#' real time as they were identified after testing. Because of the
#' widespread shortage of testing, however, the data is necessarily
#' limited in the picture it presents of the outbreak.
#' 
#' We have used this data to power our maps and reporting tracking the
#' outbreak, and it is now being made available to the public in
#' response to requests from researchers, scientists and government
#' officials who would like access to the data to better understand
#' the outbreak.
#' 
#' The data begins with the first reported coronavirus case in
#' Washington State on Jan. 21, 2020. We will publish regular updates
#' to the data in this repository.

#' @importFrom dplyr bind_rows
#' @importFrom lubridate ymd
#' @importFrom readr read_csv cols
#'
#' @note See \url{https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data#geographic-exceptions}. Also,
#'     This dataset contains county data with "holes" in reporting, dates with no
#'     reported results. Also, records with "Unknown" county are removed since
#'     these records appear to NOT be cumulative data, but incidence data?

#' @section Licensing:
#'
#' The NYTimes provides a license that states:
#'
#' In general, we are making this data publicly available for broad,
#' noncommercial public use including by medical and public health
#' researchers, policymakers, analysts and local news media.
#' 
#' If you use this data, you must attribute it to “The New York Times”
#' in any publication. If you would like a more expanded description
#' of the data, you could say “Data from The New York Times, based on
#' reports from state and local health agencies.”
#'
#' If you use it in an online presentation, we would appreciate it if
#' you would link to our U.S. tracking page at
#' \url{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html}.

#' @return a five-column (for states) or six-column (for counties) tibble
#'   - date: observation date
#'   - county: county (or sometimes city), see \url{https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/} for details
#'   - state: present in both the state and county data. Note that simply aggregating by state will
#'     sometimes overcount when working with the `county` level data. See \url{https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/} for details.
#'   - fips: The Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 6-4 (FIPS 6-4)
#'     was a five-digit Federal Information Processing Standards code which uniquely
#'     identified counties and county equivalents in the United States, certain U.S.
#'     possessions, and certain freely associated states.
#'   - count: number of cases (cumulative)
#'   - subset: `deaths` or `confirmed`
