#' United States state and county level data from USAFacts
#'
#' A single dataset from USAFacts that has state and county
#' data included.
#'
#' @details
#'
#' From the USAFacts website:
#'
#' Methodology: This interactive feature aggregates data from the
#' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), state- and
#' local-level public health agencies. County-level data is confirmed
#' by referencing state and local agencies directly.
#'
#' The data for all states was last updated on March 27, 2020, at 7:00
#' AM Pacific/10:00 AM Eastern Time. We've noted below when we last
#' checked data from the states.
#' 
#' The 21 cases confirmed on the Grand Princess cruise ship on March 5
#' and 6 are attributed to the state of California, but not to any
#' counties. The national numbers also include the 45 people with
#' coronavirus repatriated from the Diamond Princess.
#' 
#' USAFacts attempts to match each case with a county, but some cases
#' counted at the state level are not allocated to counties due to
#' lack of information.
#' 
#' Because of the frequency with which we are currently updating this
#' data, they may not reflect the exact numbers reported state and
#' local government organizations or the news media. Numbers may also
#' fluctuate as agencies update their own data. At present, we are
#' working on ensuring that we can provide this data with the most
#' up-to-date information possible.
