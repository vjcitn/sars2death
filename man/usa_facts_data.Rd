\details{
From the USAFacts website:

Methodology: This interactive feature aggregates data from the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), state- and
local-level public health agencies. County-level data is confirmed
by referencing state and local agencies directly.

The data for all states was last updated on March 27, 2020, at 7:00
AM Pacific/10:00 AM Eastern Time. We've noted below when we last
checked data from the states.

The 21 cases confirmed on the Grand Princess cruise ship on March 5
and 6 are attributed to the state of California, but not to any
counties. The national numbers also include the 45 people with
coronavirus repatriated from the Diamond Princess.

USAFacts attempts to match each case with a county, but some cases
counted at the state level are not allocated to counties due to
lack of information.

Because of the frequency with which we are currently updating this
data, they may not reflect the exact numbers reported state and
local government organizations or the news media. Numbers may also
fluctuate as agencies update their own data. At present, we are
working on ensuring that we can provide this data with the most
up-to-date information possible.
