\description{
The purpose of this function is to enrich the JHU dataset
with additional country-level metadata and then get the
data into a form that can be easily written to excel or used
as a "wide-format" tabular dataset.
}
\note{
This function is really a utility function to provide
an excel format of data to folks more familiar with excel than
with R.
